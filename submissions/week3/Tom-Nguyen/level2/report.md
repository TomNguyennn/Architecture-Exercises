# What did changing parameters do?

- max_length: Longer values produced more complete responses
- temperature: Higher values made outputs more creative but sometimes less coherent
- top_k: Lower values made text repetitive; higher values added variety

# Which settings produced best results?
- max_length = 100
- temperature = 1.0
- top_k = 50
